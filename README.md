# Evaluation of HiGHS

## Evaluation results for various versions of HiGHS

1. Results for **HiGHS version 1.12.0** are listed in [here](./evaluation/v1.12.0/README.md).

## HiGHS

1. **HiGHS** is software for the definition, modification and solution of large scale sparse linear optimization models.

2. **HiGHS** is freely available from GitHub under the MIT licence and has no third-party dependencies.

3. **HiGHS** can solve [linear programming (LP)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_programming) models as well as [mixed integer linear programming (MILP)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_programming#Integer_unknowns) of the form:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\min                \quad &amp; c^T  x        \\
\textrm{subject to} \quad &amp; L \le Ax \le U  \\
                          &amp; l \le x \le u,
\end{aligned}
$$

## MIPLIB

1. The **HiGHS** was evaluated using problems from the [**MIPLIB database**](https://miplib.zib.de/).

2. The current maintainers of the **MIPLIB** website and its content are Ambros Gleixner and Mark Turner.

4. The Abstract of the article "[MIPLIB 2017: Data-Driven Compilation of the 6th Mixed-Integer Programming Library](https://doi.org/10.1007/s12532-020-00194-3)":

> We report on the selection process leading to the sixth version of the Mixed Integer Programming Library, MIPLIB 2017. Selected from an initial pool of 5721 instances, the new MIPLIB 2017 collection consists of 1065 instances. A subset of 240 instances was specially selected for benchmarking solver performance. For the first time, these sets were compiled using a data-driven selection process supported by the solution of a sequence of mixed integer optimization problems, which encode requirements on diversity and balancedness with respect to instance features and performance data.
